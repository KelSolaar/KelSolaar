### Hi! My name is Thomas Mansencal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a maintainer of [Colour](https://github.com/colour-science/colour) and the related projects at [colour-science](https://github.com/colour-science).

**Colour** is my contribution to Open Source Software with a library that people can use to validate their colorimetric computations and grow their knowledge about light and colour: [Google](https://www.google.com/) engineers used it to improve [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) colour processing correctness!

I'm also involved with a lot of Open Source Software projects such as the [Academy Color Encoding System (ACES)](https://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces) or [OpenColorIO](https://opencolorio.org/) and try to spread as much as possible the knowledge about colorimetry.
